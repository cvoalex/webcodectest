## üéÆ Why Current Results Are Limited

All current benchmarks run **during gaming**, which affects:
- CPU scheduling (game gets priority)
- GPU contention (game uses GPU)
- Memory bandwidth
- Thread scheduling

**Expected improvement after gaming:** 30-50% faster!

## üî¨ Technical Insights

### Why Python Parallel Works Well:
1. **True parallelism**: Separate processes bypass GIL for inference
2. **Efficient batching**: 4 frames at once reduces overhead
3. **RAM caching**: No disk I/O during processing
4. **Optimized compositing**: Fast PIL/OpenCV operations

### Why Go Should Be Faster:
1. **No GIL**: True parallel execution
2. **Lightweight goroutines**: Lower overhead than Python threads
3. **Native performance**: Compiled code, no interpretation
4. **Better memory management**: More control over allocations
5. **Efficient concurrency**: Built into language design

### The Key: Parallel + Batch + Composite
- **Parallel**: Multiple workers process simultaneously
- **Batch**: Each worker processes multiple frames together
- **Composite**: Full pipeline to final output

**Reasoning:**
- Go's native performance: +10-20%
- No GIL: +5-10%
- Better memory management: +5%
- Goroutine efficiency: +5%
- Total potential: +25-45%

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Python Approach:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = []
    for chunk in frame_chunks:
        future = executor.submit(process_chunk, chunk)
        futures.append(future)
    results = [f.result() for f in futures]
```

### Go Approach:
```go
resultChan := make(chan BatchResult, numWorkers)
for _, job := range jobs {
    go processBatchWorkerWithComposite(inferencer, job, resultChan)
}
for i := 0; i < numWorkers; i++ {
    result := <-resultChan
    results[result.startIdx] = result
}
```

**Key Difference:** Go's channels and goroutines are more efficient than Python's threading!
