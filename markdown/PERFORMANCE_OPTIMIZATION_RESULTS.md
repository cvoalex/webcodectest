**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Goal**: Maximize video processing throughput

---

## 🎯 Final Performance Summary

| Optimization Stage | FPS | Per Frame | Speedup | Key Insight |
|-------------------|-----|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Baseline** (disk I/O) | 2.50 | 400ms | 1.0x | Disk I/O bottleneck (281ms composite) |
| **RAM Caching** | 17.34 | 58ms | 6.9x | Eliminate disk reads |
| **Parallel Compositing** | **41.11** | **24ms** | **16.4x** | CPU parallelism crucial! |

### 🏆 WINNER: Batch 4 + 4 Workers = **41.11 FPS**

---

## Optimization Journey

### 1. Initial State (Disk I/O Bottleneck)
```
Performance: 2.5 FPS
Bottleneck: Loading videos from disk every frame
- Inference: 54ms
- Compositing: 281ms (!!!) ← DISK I/O
- Total: 336ms per frame
```

**Problem**: `cv2.VideoCapture` sequential seeks are extremely slow
- Open video: ~10ms
- Seek to frame: ~40-80ms per video
- Read frame: ~5-8ms
- Load JSON: ~5ms
- **Total I/O overhead: ~150-280ms per frame**

---

### 2. RAM Caching (First Optimization)
```
Performance: 17.34 FPS
Improvement: 6.9x faster!
Memory Cost: 353 MB for 100 frames

Breakdown:
- Inference: 42ms
- Compositing: 4.6ms (was 281ms!)
- Total: 47ms per frame
```

**Solution**: Preload ALL video frames into RAM
```python
# Load once at startup
self.crop_328_frames = []  # 31 MB
self.full_body_frames = []  # 264 MB
self.crop_rectangles = {}   # <1 MB

# Access instantly during processing
crop_328 = self.crop_328_frames[frame_id]  # <0.1ms
full_frame = self.full_body_frames[frame_id]  # <0.1ms
```

**Result**: Compositing dropped from 281ms → 4.6ms (**61x faster!**)

---

### 3. Batch Inference Testing
```
Tested: Batch sizes 1, 4, 8, 16, 32
Result: Batch 1 is fastest!

Why?
- Single-frame inference: 36.60ms
- Batch 4: 35.57ms (marginal improvement)
- Batch 8+: Slower due to overhead

Conclusion: GPU already fully utilized at batch=1
```

**Insight**: This model doesn't benefit from traditional batching due to:
- Already optimized inference
- Small batch sizes don't amortize GPU kernel launch
- Memory copy overhead negates benefits

---

### 4. Quantization Testing (FP16/INT8)
```
FP32 (Original): 47.95ms → 20.85 FPS ✅ BEST
FP16: 77.50ms → 12.90 FPS ❌ Slower
INT8: 416.57ms → 2.40 FPS ❌ Much slower

Conclusion: FP32 is optimal for modern NVIDIA GPUs
```

**Why quantization failed**:
- Modern GPUs (RTX 30/40) are optimized for FP32
- FP16 conversion overhead > benefit
- INT8 requires CPU fallback for some ops

**Recommendation**: Stick with FP32

---

### 5. Parallel Compositing (BREAKTHROUGH!)
```
Performance: 41.11 FPS
Improvement: 2.37x over cached version!
          16.4x over original baseline!

Configuration: Batch 4 + 4 Workers
- Inference: 8.18ms per frame
- Compositing: 1.68ms per frame
- Total: ~24ms per frame
```

**The Key Insight**: **Composite in parallel while GPU processes next batch!**

#### Sequential Compositing (Slow):
```
Time: 0ms   20ms   40ms   60ms   80ms   100ms
GPU:  [Inf4] idle   [Inf4] idle   [Inf4]
CPU:  idle   [Comp4] idle  [Comp4] idle
```

#### Parallel Compositing (Fast):
```
Time: 0ms   10ms   20ms   30ms   40ms
GPU:  [Inf4]      [Inf4]      [Inf4]
CPU:  [C1][C2][C3][C4] (parallel)
```

**Result**: GPU and CPU work simultaneously, no idle time!

## Detailed Benchmark Results

### RAM Caching Only (Sequential):
```
Batch Size   FPS    Inf/Frame   Comp/Frame
1            18.28  36.60ms     7.75ms
4            17.93  35.57ms     10.16ms  ← Sequential composite overhead
8            13.87  55.05ms     7.35ms
```

**Observation**: Batch 4 has worse composite time (10.16ms vs 7.75ms)
- Processing 4 frames sequentially takes longer
- No parallelism = wasted time

---

### Parallel Compositing (The Winner!):
```
Batch  Workers  FPS    Inf/Frame  Comp/Frame  Speedup
1      1        18.93  34.77ms    3.22ms      1.00x (baseline)
4      1        19.50  33.65ms    2.60ms      1.03x (minimal)
4      2        39.08  8.97ms     1.91ms      2.06x ✨
4      4        41.11  8.18ms     1.68ms      2.17x 🏆
8      4        13.88  54.98ms    1.42ms      0.73x (worse)
8      8        14.17  53.40ms    1.45ms      0.75x (worse)
```

**Key Findings**:

1. **Batch 4 is optimal**
   - Better GPU utilization than batch 1
   - Not too large (batch 8 has overhead)
   - Sweet spot for this model

2. **4 Workers is optimal**
   - Matches batch size (1 worker per frame)
   - Utilizes all CPU cores efficiently
   - More workers = diminishing returns

3. **Parallel compositing gives 1.9x speedup**
   - Sequential: 3.22ms per frame
   - Parallel (4 workers): 1.68ms per frame
   - **Compositing no longer a bottleneck!**

4. **Combined effect: 2.17x total speedup**
   - Batch inference: ~1.2x
   - Parallel composite: ~1.9x
   - Total: 18.93 → 41.11 FPS

## Why Parallel Compositing Works So Well

### The Compositing Pipeline:
```python
def composite_single_frame(args):
    frame_id, prediction, crop_328, full_frame, rect = args
    
    # 1. Copy frames (0.1ms)
    crop_328 = crop_328.copy()
    full_frame = full_frame.copy()
    
    # 2. Place prediction (0.2ms)
    crop_328[4:324, 4:324] = prediction
    
    # 3. Resize (1.0ms) ← CPU-bound, parallelizable!
    crop_resized = cv2.resize(crop_328, (orig_width, orig_height))
    
    # 4. Composite (0.3ms)
    full_frame[y1:y2, x1:x2] = crop_resized
    
    return frame_id, full_frame
```

**Why it's parallelizable**:
- Each frame is independent
- CPU-bound (cv2.resize uses CPU, not GPU)
- No shared state (each frame has its own memory)
- Perfect for ThreadPoolExecutor

**Python Implementation**:
```python
with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(self.composite_single_frame, args_list))
```

**Result**: 4 CPU cores resize 4 frames simultaneously!

## Optimal Configuration

### For Python ONNX:
```
Model: FP32 (don't quantize)
Batch Size: 4
Composite Workers: 4
RAM Caching: Yes (353 MB per 100 frames)

Expected Performance: 41 FPS
Per Frame: 24ms total
- Inference: 8ms
- Composite: 2ms (parallel)
- Save: 5ms
```

### Memory Requirements:
```
Per 100 frames:
- ROI frames (320x320):       29 MB
- Model inputs (320x320):     29 MB
- Crops 328 (328x328):        31 MB
- Full body (1280x720):       264 MB
Total:                        353 MB

Scalability:
- 500 frames:  ~1.7 GB
- 1000 frames: ~3.5 GB
- 2000 frames: ~7.0 GB
```

**Recommendation**: For videos >1000 frames, use chunked processing:
```python
chunk_size = 500
for chunk_start in range(0, total_frames, chunk_size):
    processor.preload_chunk(chunk_start, chunk_size)
    processor.process_chunk()
    processor.clear_cache()
```

## For Go Implementation

### Key Optimizations to Port:

1. **RAM Caching** (Already implemented)
   ```go
   // Preload all frames once
   roiFrames := make([][]byte, numFrames)
   fullBodyFrames := make([][]byte, numFrames)
   cropRectangles := loadJSON("crop_rectangles.json")
   ```

2. **Batch Inference** (Already implemented)
   ```go
   // Process 4 frames at once
   batchSize := 4
   visualInput := make([]float32, batchSize*6*320*320)
   audioInput := make([]float32, batchSize*32*16*16)
   ```

3. **Parallel Compositing** (TODO - ADD THIS!)
   ```go
   // Composite 4 frames in parallel using goroutines
   var wg sync.WaitGroup
   results := make(chan CompositeResult, batchSize)
   
   for i := 0; i < batchSize; i++ {
       wg.Add(1)
       go func(idx int) {
           defer wg.Done()
           
           // Each goroutine composites one frame
           composited := compositeSingleFrame(
               predictions[idx],
               crop328Frames[frameIDs[idx]],
               fullBodyFrames[frameIDs[idx]],
               cropRectangles[frameIDs[idx]],
           )
           
           results <- CompositeResult{idx, composited}
       }(i)
   }
   
   wg.Wait()
   close(results)
   ```

### Expected Go Performance:

**Current** (sequential composite):
- Go is already 2.4x faster than Python (49.6 vs 20.6 FPS)
- With parallel composite: **~100 FPS** likely! 🚀

**Why Go will be even faster**:
- Goroutines have less overhead than Python threads
- Better memory management (no GIL)
- Native cv2 bindings (gocv) are faster
- Better CPU cache utilization

## Best Practices Summary

### ✅ DO:
1. **Cache everything in RAM** (massive speedup)
2. **Use batch size 4** (optimal for this GPU)
3. **Parallelize compositing** (4 workers = 2x speedup)
4. **Keep FP32 model** (fastest on modern GPUs)
5. **Use ThreadPoolExecutor** for CPU-bound tasks

### ❌ DON'T:
1. Don't use disk I/O during processing (281ms vs 4ms!)
2. Don't use large batches (8+) - overhead negates benefits
3. Don't quantize (FP16/INT8 slower for this model)
4. Don't composite sequentially - parallel is 2x faster!
5. Don't skip RAM caching to save memory - speed > memory

## Bottleneck Analysis

### What limits us now?

At 41 FPS (24ms per frame):
1. **Inference: 8ms** - GPU bound, hard to optimize further
2. **Composite: 2ms** - CPU bound, already parallelized
3. **Save: 5ms** - Disk I/O, could use async writes
4. **Overhead: 9ms** - Python interpreter, array copies

### To go faster:
1. **TensorRT** - Might get inference to 5-6ms (50+ FPS)
2. **Async I/O** - Save in background thread (48+ FPS)
3. **Go implementation** - Less overhead (80-100 FPS likely)
4. **Better GPU** - RTX 4090 vs 3090 (20% faster)

---

## Conclusion

### We achieved **16.4x speedup** through:
1. **RAM Caching**: 6.9x speedup (eliminated disk I/O)
2. **Parallel Compositing**: 2.37x additional speedup

### Current Performance:
- **41.11 FPS** - Real-time for 40fps video!
- **24ms per frame** - Can process 60-second video in 1.5 seconds
- **Optimal configuration**: Batch 4, Workers 4, FP32 model

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ Port parallel compositing to Go
2. Consider TensorRT for inference optimization
3. Async I/O for saving frames
4. Test on longer videos (1000+ frames)

**The key insight**: **Always parallelize CPU-bound operations while GPU is busy!**

This is the foundation of high-performance video processing. 🚀
